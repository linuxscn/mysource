<p>
    This is the reference document for the REST API and resources provided by JIRA. The REST APIs are developers who
    want to integrate JIRA with other standalone or web applications, and administrators who want to script interactions
    with the JIRA server.
</p>

<p>
    If you are after an introductory, high-level view of the JIRA REST API, rather than an exhaustive reference
    document, then the best place to start is the
    <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+APIs">JIRA REST API home</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>
<p>
    Because the REST API is based on open standards, you can use any web development language to access the API. If you
    are using Java, however, the easiest way to get started using the JIRA REST API is to download with the
    <a href="https://studio.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JRJC/Home">JIRA REST Java Client</a> (JRJC) and use it as a
    library within your own application. For other languages, refer to the
    <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+APIs">JIRA REST API home</a> for code examples.
</p>

<h2><a name="JIRA4.2RESTAPIdiscussionpoints-StructureoftheRESTURIs"></a>Structure of the REST URIs</h2>

<p>
    JIRA's REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths. To use a REST API, your application will
    make an HTTP request and parse the response. The JIRA REST API uses
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> as its communication format, and the standard HTTP methods like
    <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> (see API descriptions below for which
    methods are available for each resource). URIs for JIRA's REST API resource have the following structure:
</p>

<pre>
http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name
</pre>

<p>
    Currently there are two API names available, which will be discussed further below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>auth</code> - for authentication-related operations, and</li>
    <li><code>api</code> - for everything else.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The current API version is <code>2</code>. However, there is also a symbolic version, called <code>latest</code>,
    which resolves to the latest version supported by the given JIRA instance. As an example, if you wanted to retrieve
    the JSON representation of issue <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-9">JRA-9</a> from Atlassian's public
    issue tracker, you would access:
</p>

<pre>
    <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-9" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-9</a>
</pre>

<p>
    There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a> document that
    contains the documentation for each resource in the JIRA REST API. It is available
    <a href="jira-rest-plugin.wadl">here</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="expansion">Expansion in the REST APIs</h2>

<p>
    In order to minimise network traffic and server CPU usage, the JIRA REST API sometimes uses a technique called
    expansion. When a REST resource uses expansion then parts of that resource will not be included in the JSON response
    unless explicitly requested. The way to request those fragments to be included is by using the <code>expand</code>
    query parameter.
</p>

<p>
    You can use the <code>expand</code> query parameter to specify a comma-separated list of entities that you want
    expanded, identifying each of them by name. For example, appending <code>?expand=names,renderedFields</code> to an
    issue's URI requests the inclusion of the translated field names and the HTML-rendered field values in the response.
    Continuing with our example above, we would use the following URL to get that information for JRA-9:
</p>

<pre>
    <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-9?expand=names,renderedFields" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/JRA-9?expand=names,renderedFields</a>
</pre>

<p>
    To discover the identifiers for each entity, look at the <code>expand</code> property in the parent object. In the
    JSON example below, the resource declares widgets as being expandable.
</p>

<div class="methods">
    <pre><code>{"expand":"widgets", "self":"http://www.example.com/jira/rest/api/resource/KEY-1", "widgets":{"widgets":[],"size":5}}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
    You can use the dot notation to specify expansion of entities within another entity. For example
    <code>?expand=widgets.fringels</code> would expand the widgets collection and also the fringel property on each
    widget.
</p>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<p>
    Any authentication that works against JIRA will work against the REST API. <b>The prefered authentication methods
    are OAuth and HTTP Basic (when using SSL)</b>, which are both documented in the
    <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+API+Tutorials">JIRA REST API Tutorials</a>. Other
    supported methods include: HTTP Cookies, and Trusted Applications.
</p>

<p>
    The log-in page uses cookie-based authentication, so if you are using JIRA in a browser you can call REST from
    Javascript on the page and rely on the authentication that the browser has established. Callers wanting to reproduce
    the behaviour of the JIRA log-in page (for example, to display authentication error messages to users) or who are
    calling both the REST and SOAP API can <code>POST</code> to the <code>/auth/1/session</code> resource as per the
    documentation below.
</p>

<p>
    You can find OAuth code samples in several programming languages at
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassian_tutorial/atlassian-oauth-examples/src">bitbucket.org/atlassian_tutorial/atlassian-oauth-examples</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="experimental">Experimental methods</h2>

<p>
    Methods marked as experimental may change without an earlier notice. We are looking for your feedback for these methods.
