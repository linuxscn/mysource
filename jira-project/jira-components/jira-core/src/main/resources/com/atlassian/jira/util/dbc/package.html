    This package contains utility classes for performing Design By Contract (DBC) assertions. For example, use
    <code>Assertions.notNull("myParam", myParam)</code> to check that the value of myParam is not null, and if it is, to
    throw an IllegalArgumentException.
</p>
<p>
    Other suitable classes here would check Collections types for non-null elements, or to check the types of
    the contents of collections.
