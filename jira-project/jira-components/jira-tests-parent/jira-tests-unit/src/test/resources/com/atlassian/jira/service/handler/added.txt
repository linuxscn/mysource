    <title>JIRA Introduction</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>The Dashboard is your first page when you sign into JIRA. Also known as the home page. It can be configured to
      display many different types of information, depending on you areas of interest. JIRA comes pre-configured with a
      set of standard dashboard portlets. Portlets are the information boxes on the Dashboard.</p>

    <p>The portlets can be re-ordered, switched between the left and right columns, additional portlets can be added,
      and some portlets can be configured.</p>

    <p>The portlets available are as follows:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Portlet</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Default</th>
