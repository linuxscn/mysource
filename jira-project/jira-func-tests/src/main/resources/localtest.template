# If the browser path is set then when a test fails the func test framework will try and start
# the browser with a temporary file of captured web output.  if its not set then no harm
# and System.out will be used to dump the web response.
#
# On a Mac it "just works". This will open the file with the default browser
# The "-g" tells OSX to not bring the browser to the foreground, this is handy when you have
# lots of test failures. If you'd rather have the browser brought to the foreground, remove the "-g"

# By default, we open one browser tab for every func test failure with a limit of 5. Further failures
# will still generate dump artifacts, they just won't have a browser automatically opened and pointing at them.
# You can change the default by setting this property to a different number. If you set this to a negative number
# then there is no limit to the number of browser windows that will be opened.

# To run TPM LDAP tests locally first set jira.edition = tpm_ldap above
# See https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/LDAP+Servers for info on the crowd-op23 OpenLDAP server
# In theory you could set this up for ldap.type = ActiveDirectory, but it would require SSL certificates to be installed Client-side.
# Uncomment the following:
#ldap.type = OpenLdap
#ldap.server = crowd-op23
